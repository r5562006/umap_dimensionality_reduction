# UMAP Dimensionality Reduction Project

This project demonstrates dimensionality reduction using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) in Python. The script generates random data, applies UMAP for dimensionality reduction, and visualizes the results.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `umap-learn`
- `matplotlib`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/umap_dimensionality_reduction.git
    cd umap_dimensionality_reduction
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the script to perform UMAP dimensionality reduction and visualize the results:
```sh
python umap_dimensionality_reduction.py
